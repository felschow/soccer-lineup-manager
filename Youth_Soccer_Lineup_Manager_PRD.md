# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Youth Soccer Lineup Manager

### Executive Summary
The Youth Soccer Lineup Manager is a web-based application designed to help youth soccer coaches efficiently manage player rotations, ensure fair playing time, and optimize team formations across multiple game periods. The application addresses the common challenge of balancing player development, position preferences, and mandatory rotation requirements in youth soccer.

---

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Youth soccer coaches struggle to manually track and balance:
- Fair playing time distribution across all players
- Player position preferences and capabilities
- Mandatory goalkeeper rotations and preparation periods
- Substitution patterns that maintain team cohesion
- Complex rotation rules across multiple game periods (typically 8x 7.5-minute periods)

### Pain Points
1. **Manual Tracking Complexity**: Coaches must mentally juggle 12 players across 8 periods with varying position capabilities
2. **Fairness Concerns**: Ensuring each player gets adequate field time and doesn't sit out too many consecutive periods
3. **Goalkeeper Management**: Special rules for goalkeeper rotation, including mandatory "jersey preparation" periods
4. **Real-time Decision Making**: Need to quickly visualize and adjust lineups during games
5. **Documentation**: Lack of clear visual records for post-game analysis and parent communication

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Youth soccer coaches (ages 8-14 competitive leagues)
- **Secondary**: Assistant coaches and team managers
- **Tertiary**: Parents seeking transparency in playing time allocation
